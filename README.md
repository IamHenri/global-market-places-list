# Goal : create an API 
API  as a test, but if ever it can be helpful to anyone, this will make my day. 

# Todo : 
## Reading the data : ALL
You can access all the data, sorted by continent and by city. 

## Reading the data : Per continent
You can specify a continent to have only the belonging market places 

## Reading the data : per city
So if you need the market places for one city, ask for them. You'll be notified is there is no market place in this city (in this database. 

## Updating the data 
You can send an update for any market place. I'll revceive it and if everything is correct I'll update the list. 

Don't hésitate to fork this work to have you own database. 


# Disclaimer
This list is before everything a technical test to developp a simple API with useful data for some business. In it's first version, it may be not currently exact. But will be udpated to match with the current worldwide market places. Use it for your business if you want, but at your own risks.
